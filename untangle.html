      <h3><b>Overview</b></h3>
          <p>Our clients need a way to find a therapist with ease at their own time in the comfort of their own home / space because flexibility is important to them and they won’t need to worry about traveling to and from places.
            <br><br>
            We will know this to be true when we see clients booking more appointments with our therapists through our app.</p>
            <h3><b>Purpose</b></h3>
            <p>Improving mental health is our aim with the flexibility of time, pace, and location. From chatting to video calls with your therapist, you can share your emotions and thoughts to a professional who can help you untangle the threads that keep you trapped within your mind. Our application also features journaling and mood tracking as a way to reflect upon your days and see how you can improve your wellbeing. </p>
            <h3><b>The Problem</b></h3>
      <p>I am presenting a case study that highlights my design skills as a way to build and expand my professional network. By sharing the details of my creative process and the outcomes of my work, I aim to demonstrate my expertise and connect with like-minded professionals. This approach not only showcases my capabilities but also fosters meaningful relationships within the design community, opening doors to new opportunities and collaborations.</p>
    <h3><b>Goals</b></h3>   
    <p>The goal is to increase site traffic and boost the use of services by implementing targeted strategies. By analyzing user behavior and adjusting tactics accordingly, the aim is to not only attract more visitors but also encourage them to become long-term users, ultimately driving sustained growth and success for the platform.</p>

  <h3><b>User Research</b></h3>
  <p>I did a competitive analysis between betterhelp and talkspace to have a better
    comprehension of what the two best mental health therapy apps have in
    common and what makes them both stand out from the rest. From there, I
    conducted user surveys and interviews on what behaviors, attitudes, needs, and
    goals I should focus on for my mental health therapy app. With the insights and
    feedback received, I created two user personas to reflect upon the goals of
    Untangle.</p>

  <br><br>
  <h3><b>User Interviews and Surveys</b></h3>
  <p>Conducted user interviews with the following goals in mind:<br>
    1. Identifying users' pain points, behaviors, attitudes, and needs about mental health<br>
    2. Determining what features and fuctions users enjoy in mental health apps<br>
  <br>
  Based on interviews and surveys, I have gathered insight on how to better understand the target audience for Untangle and later created user personas.
  </p>
    <br>
  <h3><b>User Personas and User Journeys</b></h3>
  <p>I created Mieko and Giovanni in hopes of having a better visualization and idea of the user’s goals, wants, needs,
    and behaviors. This enabled me to have a different POV that helped with solving real life problems. User journeys
    were then created to emphasize the important features of the application that the personas would like to achieve.</p>

    <br><br>
    With Mieko and Giovanni, I fabricated user journey maps and user flows with what I believed were important features with Untangle. Submitting a journal entry, matching with the therapist, and saving articles were my top three at the time in importance. I wanted users to be able to use Untangle as a standalone application as well with the journaling and mood tracking features. Upon further debate about what is exactly important to focus on Untangle, I decided to update the top three focused features to be submitting a journal entry, booking an appointment with a therapist, and being able to message with your therapist.​​
  <br><br>
    <h3><b>Site Map</b></h3>
  <p>I conducted card sorting with OptimalSort and tested participants to see which features
    of Untangle they think would go where with specific categories. With the results, I
    revised a site map that has better functionality and flow for the features of Untangle.</p>

  <h3><b>Prototype and Usability Testing</b></h3>
  <p>I drew up low fidelity wireframes to get a feel of how I would want the layout to be, but it still felt a little too
    simple for me. After going through trials and errors, and receiving feedback, my mid-fidelity wireframes started
    to flow a little better. I conducted usability testing to better assess the functionality of the prototype and I
    received valuable feedback from participants that helped me improve my prototype into its high-fidelity stage.
    As I progressed into the high-fidelity prototype, I did some peer collaborations to gain even more feedback with
    the high-fi stage. With all the comments received, Untangle’s high-fidelity prototype felt very much so polished.</p>

    <center><h2><b>Lessons Learned</b></h2></center> 
    Learning UX from beginning to end has been quite a journey, teaching me the importance of always focusing on the user's experience. Navigating through various phases and discovering new feedback techniques has been invaluable. I've realized that both receiving and providing feedback are crucial aspects of UX Design. Adopting different perspectives is key to understanding how others perceive things, which in turn helps us better grasp users' needs, behaviors, attitudes, and goals. This experience has provided me with valuable insights on how to approach my next project.<br>
Through trial and error, I've embraced feedback and am committed to continually improving Untangle to deliver the optimal user experience. Each critique brings us closer to crafting a masterpiece.​​
